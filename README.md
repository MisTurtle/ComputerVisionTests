# Computer Vision Tests

Just got interested in writing some computer vision procedures, so here they are :)

Some kind of API I quickly wrote is in the ``/feed`` folder, it gives the code a more visually appealing look with the adding of filters in a list. It also makes it easy to debug and/or display steps during the processing of an image and/or video.

Test projects are located in the ``/tests`` folder. There aren't a lot right now but it'll build up over time :)
